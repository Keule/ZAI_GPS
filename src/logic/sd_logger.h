/**
 * @file sd_logger.h
 * @brief SD-Card Data Logger – public API.
 *
 * Records navigation/steering data to CSV files on an SD card.
 * Activated/deactivated via a hardware switch (GPIO 47, active LOW).
 *
 * Architecture (TASK-029):
 *   - Control loop calls sdLoggerRecord() to buffer one sample into
 *     a PSRAM-backed ring buffer (~1 MB, ~53 min at 10 Hz)
 *   - The maintTask (lowest priority, Core 0) periodically drains
 *     the ring buffer and writes CSV records to the SD card
 *   - maintTask also handles NTRIP connect/reconnect and ETH monitoring
 *   - The SD card shares SPI2_HOST (FSPI) with the sensor bus,
 *     so the sensor SPI is temporarily released during writes
 *   - The hardware switch is checked before each flush cycle
 *
 * Usage:
 *   sdLoggerMaintInit(); // call once in setup() after OTA check
 *   // In control loop:
 *   sdLoggerRecord();    // buffer one sample (subsampled internally)
